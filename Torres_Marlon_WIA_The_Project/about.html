    <p>"I'm like a Wild Card... you never know what to expect when I play a song in any given moment, I let my art speak for itself; so you just have to experience it to really get the picture." - DJ MGG</p>
          <p>DJ MGG decided to venture into the world of entertainment in the summer of 1989 by becoming a local DJ in his place of birth Panama City, Panama. Since then, DJ MGG has been amping crowds with the passion and intensity he has for music. He started with a local Panamanian sound system, Rams Disco, which had one of Panama's finest MCs and DJs, Alejandro Smith aka DJ Lea. DJ Lea's unique and aggressive approach towards the crowd heavily influenced DJ MGG's DJing style. "When DJ Lea put on records he started with hits and ended with hits," explained DJ MGG, "He didn't wait to warm the crowd up he got them hype from jump." DJ MGG was fascinated by this style and took note as he learned whatever he could from the DJs around him.</p>
          
          <p> In 1990, he started a partnership with friends, Tito and Nilka, also known as Brother X, Deejaying at one of Panama's top clubs for teens, Magic Discotheque. It was through this venue that he quickly built a reputation that had him spinning all over his hometown. He continued to learn the ropes from other local DJ's such as Renato, DJ Pablito, Rolando Guillen, Martin Pincay and many others, placing him as one of the city's TOP DJ's.</p>
          
          <p>In the summer of 1994 he arrived in Atlanta and continued where he left off, taking the city by storm and creating a new look in the Latin scene. He began DJing with PR Productions and working with Atlanta's Latin Festival Committee catering to the needs of the Latinos in the Atlanta area. It didn't take long for DJ MGG to build a reputation in Atlanta. He quickly sparked the interest of local radio stations and local clubs and lounges. </p>
          
          <p>In 2005 and 2006 he won the Latin DJ Competition in Atlanta, placing him as one of Atlanta's best. In 2007 he joined indie record label, Movement507, working along side "La Jefa" Kerisa Jones bringing something different to music lovers not just in the US but Worldwide. He is looking forward to making that transition to producing and taking his DJing to an international level. </p>
